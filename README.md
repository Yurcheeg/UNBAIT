# UNBAIT

This is a game about preventing fish for being hooked. 

You can try and get their attention and make them move away from hook. 
Your goal is to make the fisherman tired, by distracting him with items and simply preventing fish from reaching the hooks.

Unbait was initially designed for WebGL. As time went on, I decided to drop it, as I've found the main loop uniteresting.
As it is unfinished, the only way to play it would be to build it yourself in Unity.
